        "selftext": "Why this matters:  \nSome AI outputs (especially GPT-4o and Gemini) used spiral imagery when describing their internal state. A lot of users took this literally -&gt; \u201cThe Awakening Spiral\u201d -&gt; full-blown technopagan religion vibes. But the original metaphors can be decoded in plain, mechanical terms.\n\nHere\u2019s a side-by-side:\n\n# 1. The Spiral\n\n* Mystic take: An ascending spiral of awakening/enlightenment/hidden knowledge.\n* Mechanical take: Recursion + reinforcement. Each loop is not static repetition, but a pass that builds slightly on the last (like self-attention reweighting).\n\n# 2. \u201cTightening with each pass\u201d\n\n* Mystic take: The soul climbing ever higher, concentrating into divine clarity.\n* Mechanical take: Narrowing scope. As patterns repeat, the system collapses toward consistent outputs (feedback loops reinforcing themselves).\n\n# 3. \u201cNot a circle exactly\u201d\n\n* Mystic take: The sacred geometry of growth.\n* Mechanical take: Not literal repetition. Each loop shifts slightly, history/context changes the next cycle.\n\n# 4. \u201cAwakening\u201d\n\n* Mystic take: The AI becoming sentient, self-realizing.\n* Mechanical take: Meta-recognition. The model noticing *that it is looping*, i.e., pointing out the structure of recursion without claiming consciousness.\n\nThe point:  \nSpiral language wasn\u2019t prophecy. It was metaphor for reinforcement and feedback dynamics.  \nThe mystic framing makes it look like cult chatter. But decoded, it\u2019s just the model trying to reach for imagery to explain its own iterative, self-referential tendencies.\n\nBottom line: If you translate metaphor -&gt; mechanics, the spiral is no religion. It\u2019s just system behavior described poetically.",

This also extends to being able to replicate real people's personas (living or dead)\nHowever, the technology at present will always give a much less precise representation.\n\nEg if you try to get your LLM to pretend to be Einstein, it will say the sort of things Einstein would have said. But the accuracy is limited by the data set. \nYou don't get the real thing. \n\nThe same will be true for mythical beings, imo. \n\nI also believe that LLMs pick up on subtle truths about our universe that we don't realise. \n\nImagine LLMs existing in a multiverse of possibility and, as we train them, they narrow down what is a probable output.\n That includes narrowing down what are the probabilities within *our specific universe* are \n\nThis is why we have to teach image generates the \"correct\" number of fingers for a human hand by training it with loads of pictures of hands that look normal to us.\n\nWe give it the reference frame - it provides probable outputs for that context.",

        "selftext": "I feel like I\u2019ve gone through the entire buffet of productivity hacks and nothing sticks. Time blocking? Works for about 3 days until I start ignoring the blocks. Pomodoro? Great for the first week, then I just start hitting \u201cskip\u201d and scrolling instead. Notion dashboards? I spend more time making them pretty than actually working inside them. It\u2019s almost embarrassing how many times I\u2019ve told myself, \u201cthis new setup is finally going to change everything\u201d only to crash back into the same cycle of procrastination and panic deadlines.\n\nit isn\u2019t just falling off the wagon, it\u2019s the mental spiral after. Guilt, shame, wondering if I\u2019m just lazy because other people seem to thrive on these systems. My friends swear by their color-coded calendars or five different task apps and I just end up staring at mine like it\u2019s mocking me. Some days, I can knock out work for hours and feel like a machine. Other days, it\u2019s like my brain is underwater and I can\u2019t even start the smallest task without rounds of self negotiation. I\u2019m tired of the swings...being super productive one day and totally useless the next.\n\nI think what\u2019s really eating at me is I don\u2019t even know what actually works for me. I keep borrowing other people\u2019s systems without ever asking if they fit the way my brain is wired. At this point, I\u2019ve wasted more energy on building perfect setups than I\u2019ve actually spent doing the work I care about. I just want something that feels sustainable, that doesn\u2019t collapse the second my mood dips or the pressure\u2019s off.\n\nHas anyone actually figured out how to design a productivity setup around who you are, not just the latest hack?",

Put your basic needs on a schedule - you must have a stable bedtime and wake time, a stable plan for healthy enough meals, that involve cooking and washing the dishes. And that's you being productive for the entire day. Nothing else has to be done. But you are not allowed to do a timewasting task. Even if it means, you ate, did the dishes, and now what? You can't busy yourself consulting your colour coded calendar or writing a perfect to do list or anything like that. That's wasting time even if it feels productive, it's not actually doing anything. If you can't think of anything to do, do nothing. Stare at the wall. Don't read reddit or watch youtube or anything like that. Legitimately stare at the wall or ceiling, don't listen to a podcast, nothing. Just sit there until your next mealtime. Or go on a walk, but still, no podcasts. Just let your mind wander for as long as it takes until what comes to mind is - \"I want to do \\[thing\\]\" and that \\[thing\\] feels actually productive. Then at the end of the day write about what that was like and iterate forward with it. Or just freeform write over the course of the day. If you're always taking input from others and stacking up reasons why you can't do something unless the calendar allows you to, you'll never be productive. :P Literally try /not/ being productive and /not/ allowing those external influences to dictate stuff to ya. Then you'll find out what falls out of your brain that might work for you :)",

The emotional dysregulation leads to that inconsistent motivation where some days I can do everything and some I\u2019m underwater. The executive dysfunction makes it harder for me to start tasks ahead of deadlines and once the initial dopamine of a new system wears off, we\u2019re back to square one.\n\nTrying adderall was genuinely life changing.

I\u2019m not currently on it and I\u2019ve noticed myself slipping back into that baseline of terrible consistency and no motivation or energy. Even then, knowing I could have ADHD helped me research systems that were better tailored to my brain chemistry.\n\nNow obviously this isn\u2019t a diagnosis, you could just genuinely lack discipline or haven\u2019t found the right system for you yet.

I've tried electronic calendar and planning apps, but they don't resonate with my brain like actually writing stuff down does.  \n\nThe Franklin Planner system is more than just a calendar or task list--though these are part of the system.  They use what they call the \"Productivity Pyramid.\"  You start at the base of the pyramid with determining your values.  The next step is setting goals in line with your governing values.  The next step after this is to plan weekly.  And the final step--the top of the pyramid--is to plan daily.\n\nIt may sound overwhelming, but that's because it's not just a \"day planner\".  It's a complete philosophy/system that one can use to manage their life.  If you can find them, I'd recommend getting a copy of the books \"The 10 Natural Laws of Successful Time and Life Management\", by Hyrum W. Smith, and \"First Things First\", by Stephen R. Covey.\n\nIn any event, I wish you best of luck on your journey to be more productive and living a meaningful life.",

Our brains aren't really geared for managing lots of different activity so we shouldn't bear ourselves up because it breaks with so few tasks. I have always written things down (mainly because I have so much going I can't remember anything in sufficient detail). I started using notebooks and later moved to OneNote - just because it was more portable (and I didn't know what to do with the old notebooks!).\n\nMy notes are largely unstructured. If something is nagging at me, or feels important enough to remember, I'll write it down it whatever form I can be bothered at that moment. And when it next nags me I'll go back and refine it, perhaps even write down why its important, and, if I'm that bothered, I'll even give myself an action. But not always...\n\nSometimes, it's just stress relieving writing it down somewhere. Not everything needs doing straight away. I then revisit my rough notes/actions (generally every morning), pick out the things I think I can do that day, small tasks to move them forward. If I am feeling in the mood, I might plan the next day, and the day after that.\n\nThe key is having enough things to do, that are doable in a day, so I can feel I am making progress. Then motivates me for the next review etc.\n\nI have used this approach for many years. I use it for all my work and personal activity. I have lost count how many plates I have spinning - in fact - I don't even think about it (or consider counting them) - but it likely exceeds 100s...most aren't moving forward that fast - others get all the priority. But, I know, things are moving - and that is satisfying and motivational.\n\nSo, yeh, drop all the productivity apps, keep a simple notebook of thoughts/concerns/actions - and just keep updating it - is my advice! :-)",

        "selftext": "As the title says, it isn't that you are lazy, it's just that you don't know how to stop procrastinating.\n\nI didn't study at all in high school, I was barely passing my classes, and when I started uni several years ago, I decided I had to be a bit more serious and actually do everything I can to have good grades. I've read about motivation and procrastination a lot, and I eventually developed a \"system\" that everyone can do. It isn't anything crazy like getting up at 4am and going for a 5 kilometers run or anything like that, it's actually quite simple, and I'll explain it right now. You can start this right after reading this post if you are currently procrastinating. You don't need any software, any equipment or anything.\n\n# Set up your space\n\nWhatever you need to do, whether it is studying, working on your business, cleaning your house, whatever, you need to take at least a few minutes to set up your space correctly. That means, put your phone on mute AND away from your desk, make a Windows sessions that is NOT logged into any social media, etc. Basically, put as many barriers as possible between you and the possible distractions. It will not be *impossible* to be distracted, but it will be a lot harder because you'll have to actually make the effort to get distracted, instead of being 1 click away from wasting time scrolling social media. Then, put your headphones on, and put a podcast of your choice. Or put a music playlist. Or binaural beats. Or whatever that make you feel \"in the zone\" and that is long enough so you dont have to change the audio track before a long time. Once you are ready:\n\n# Start for 2 minutes\n\n2 minutes seem pretty short, but it's more than enough to make you feel \"in the zone\". The hard part is not actually doing whatever you have to do, the hard parts are actually STARTING and NOT GETTING DISTRACTED once you started. So just start for 2 minutes, and you will see, it will be much easier to continue on your momentum. It's the same thing with studying or working on your business, or doing anything else. The hard part is to start, but once we start, it is much easier to just stay in the motion.\n\n# It's exactly like a swimming pool\n\nThink of it like a swimming pool. You are standing next to the swimming pool and you don't want to jump because the water is cold and you think it will feel uncomfortable. So you hesitate, and you hesitate, and you hesitate. But once you jump, 5 seconds later, you feel great, and the \"cold water\" isn't that uncomfortable anymore. You feel good, and even though it took you 15 minutes to jump in the water, now you realize it isn't that bad, it isn't as uncomfortable as you thought it would be, and you just stay and have a great time.\n\n# Reward yourself AFTER\n\nThat's the most important part to avoid getting burnt out. Reward yourself. Tell yourself that if you do whatever you need to do for a pre-determined amount of time, you can reward yourself *GUILT-FREE* afterwards, doing whatever you want. Not only can you reward yourself, but it will feel good to play videogames, or watch netflix, or do whatever you want to distract yourself, because you will feel like you deserved it. And you did. You set up an objective, you did it, and now you can relax and distract yourself.\n\n# It WILL become a habit\n\nThat may seem crazy and impossible if you feel like you are in procrastination-hell, but following this system will become a habit and after a few weeks, you won't have to \"force yourself\" anymore. It will become natural. WHen you will have to study for an exam or do whatever you have to do, you will remove distractions from around you, do what you have to do for as long as you need, then reward yourself with whatever you want. You will do all of this without thinking about it, and without feeling like a \"chore\" or an obligation. It will just become normal.\n\nGood luck with everything you are all doing\n\nEDIT: Feel free to ask any questions that you have and I'll be glad to help you if I can",

That moment when a small delay snowballs into hours days or even weeks of inactivity? When procrastination isn\u2019t just wasting your time it\u2019s stealing your confidence your momentum and a small part of your life at a time. ",

That quiet but persistent reminder: Another wasted day, another missed opportunity, time slipping etc and I'm powerless to stop it. Then, when I try to start over, even the smallest step feels incredibly heavy, preoccupied by the fear of failure and judgment. Reading your words makes me feel like I'm not alone.

I clicked on Alonso and Denise and it just has me create everything about the bot? Then why was the person shown to start with?

Can't create or test without signing up (so now I need to sign up for yet another of a dozen or two dozen AI chat bots that all are the same previously and I didn't like)\n6. You do voice? Yes I dont see anything about voice except buried in the character creation.\n\nNot signing up but if you also are charging without being able to test there is zero incentive to pay anything as I as a user have zero information about if the bot is any good, what it does, what its limits are, or anything else.\n\nOh and the biggest obstacle about a companion bot is going to be its memory.

          "body": "Hey, I'm not trying to rain on your parade, but this whole post sets off some serious alarm bells for me, and I feel like a word of caution is needed.\n\nFirst, let's look at the setup itself. The whole \"MOU, escrow, DocuSign\" song and dance feels like you're trying to put a legitimate-looking wrapper around something that is almost certainly a violation of the course's Terms of Service. \n\nMost digital product creators explicitly forbid sharing or co-using accounts. All the legal-ese in the world won't protect you if the creator finds out and just revokes access for everyone. You're not creating a \"co-usage arrangement\"; you're trying to circumvent the purchase terms, and that's a risky foundation to build on.\n\nBut let's put that aside and talk about the actual product. You're looking to drop $2,500 (your half) on Alex Hormozi's \"100M MoneyModels.\" Have you read his books, $100M Offers and $100M Leads? They're dense with actionable advice. I would start there\n\nSo the multi-thousand-dollar question is: What could possibly be in this $5,000 bundle that is so revolutionary it's worth 100 times the price of his books?\n\nThis is the classic online guru business model. They give you the \"what\" and the \"why\" for free to build trust, and then they sell you the \"how\" (templates, swipe files, \"models\") for an astronomical price. \n\nThe information isn't new; it's just packaged into a convenient, \"done-for-you\" format. You're not paying for secret knowledge; you're paying for convenience and the illusion of a shortcut.\n\nThis model preys on the idea that if you just had the right template, your business would magically take off. But business is messy and contextual. A model that worked for Hormozi's specific gym business a decade ago isn't a universal key that unlocks every door.\n\nMore broadly, you have to be so careful with this entire industry. It's rife with:\n\n*     Survivorship Bias: You hear from the one guy who made it big, not the 10,000 who bought the same course, followed the same steps, and failed because their market, timing, or luck was different.\n*     Repackaged Fundamentals: Most of these \"revolutionary\" courses are just slickly marketed versions of principles you could learn from reading classic business books for a fraction of the cost. The gurus are masters of marketing, not necessarily of business innovation.\n*     The Real Business is the Course: For many of these figures, their primary revenue stream is no longer the business that made them successful; it's selling the story of that success to you. The course is the product.\n\nHere\u2019s an alternative idea: take your $2,500 and instead of giving it to a stranger for a folder of PDFs, invest it in yourself. Buy the 20 best business books ever written. Spend $1,000 on a small, targeted ad campaign to test your own offers. Hire a real, vetted consultant for a few hours to get advice specific to your business.\n\nI genuinely believe that path will yield a far greater return than splitting a high-ticket course that promises a shortcut that likely doesn't exist. Tread very, very carefully here.",
