It cannot. fine i'll add in my opinion it cannot.\n\nBut scientifically, we can only say that \"it can mimic the appearance of feeling and consciousness\"\n\nBut then, this is also the only thing you can say about other human beings being conscious or mimicking being conscious. Despite the lack of evidence of other people being conscious, we don't question if humans are conscious. We take it as true, with some exceptions, and thus can be said to be a form of bias.\n\nBut just because we are biased towards believing humans are conscious despite a lack of clear evidence that proves it either way, does NOT mean we should be also biased towards believing AI is conscious due to lack of evidence that proves it either way.\n\nEmpirically speaking, the panel on the right is unresolved for human consciousness just as much as it is of AI, but those questions are not actually useful for drawing any conclusions about consciousness. If you show me matrix multiplication in biological organisms leading to problem solving skills, I will be more inclined to buying that matrix multiplications on silicon can lead to consciousness. Otherwise no.\n\nThe gaps in how we describe consciousness leads to a red herring that biases us towards believing that any black box that mimics the results of conscious thought must be conscious, because the only other black box, i.e. us, we have seen that mimics consciousness is almost certainly in fact conscious, and our nature is to extrapolate entire philosophies from single sample anecdotes.",
