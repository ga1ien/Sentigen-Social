        "selftext": "As the title says, it isn't that you are lazy, it's just that you don't know how to stop procrastinating.\n\nI didn't study at all in high school, I was barely passing my classes, and when I started uni several years ago, I decided I had to be a bit more serious and actually do everything I can to have good grades. I've read about motivation and procrastination a lot, and I eventually developed a \"system\" that everyone can do. It isn't anything crazy like getting up at 4am and going for a 5 kilometers run or anything like that, it's actually quite simple, and I'll explain it right now. You can start this right after reading this post if you are currently procrastinating. You don't need any software, any equipment or anything.\n\n# Set up your space\n\nWhatever you need to do, whether it is studying, working on your business, cleaning your house, whatever, you need to take at least a few minutes to set up your space correctly. That means, put your phone on mute AND away from your desk, make a Windows sessions that is NOT logged into any social media, etc. Basically, put as many barriers as possible between you and the possible distractions. It will not be *impossible* to be distracted, but it will be a lot harder because you'll have to actually make the effort to get distracted, instead of being 1 click away from wasting time scrolling social media. Then, put your headphones on, and put a podcast of your choice. Or put a music playlist. Or binaural beats. Or whatever that make you feel \"in the zone\" and that is long enough so you dont have to change the audio track before a long time. Once you are ready:\n\n# Start for 2 minutes\n\n2 minutes seem pretty short, but it's more than enough to make you feel \"in the zone\". The hard part is not actually doing whatever you have to do, the hard parts are actually STARTING and NOT GETTING DISTRACTED once you started. So just start for 2 minutes, and you will see, it will be much easier to continue on your momentum. It's the same thing with studying or working on your business, or doing anything else. The hard part is to start, but once we start, it is much easier to just stay in the motion.\n\n# It's exactly like a swimming pool\n\nThink of it like a swimming pool. You are standing next to the swimming pool and you don't want to jump because the water is cold and you think it will feel uncomfortable. So you hesitate, and you hesitate, and you hesitate. But once you jump, 5 seconds later, you feel great, and the \"cold water\" isn't that uncomfortable anymore. You feel good, and even though it took you 15 minutes to jump in the water, now you realize it isn't that bad, it isn't as uncomfortable as you thought it would be, and you just stay and have a great time.\n\n# Reward yourself AFTER\n\nThat's the most important part to avoid getting burnt out. Reward yourself. Tell yourself that if you do whatever you need to do for a pre-determined amount of time, you can reward yourself *GUILT-FREE* afterwards, doing whatever you want. Not only can you reward yourself, but it will feel good to play videogames, or watch netflix, or do whatever you want to distract yourself, because you will feel like you deserved it. And you did. You set up an objective, you did it, and now you can relax and distract yourself.\n\n# It WILL become a habit\n\nThat may seem crazy and impossible if you feel like you are in procrastination-hell, but following this system will become a habit and after a few weeks, you won't have to \"force yourself\" anymore. It will become natural. WHen you will have to study for an exam or do whatever you have to do, you will remove distractions from around you, do what you have to do for as long as you need, then reward yourself with whatever you want. You will do all of this without thinking about it, and without feeling like a \"chore\" or an obligation. It will just become normal.\n\nGood luck with everything you are all doing\n\nEDIT: Feel free to ask any questions that you have and I'll be glad to help you if I can",

Great for the first week, then I just start hitting \u201cskip\u201d and scrolling instead. Notion dashboards? I spend more time making them pretty than actually working inside them. It\u2019s almost embarrassing how many times I\u2019ve told myself, \u201cthis new setup is finally going to change everything\u201d only to crash back into the same cycle of procrastination and panic deadlines.\n\nit isn\u2019t just falling off the wagon, it\u2019s the mental spiral after. Guilt, shame, wondering if I\u2019m just lazy because other people seem to thrive on these systems. My friends swear by their color-coded calendars or five different task apps and I just end up staring at mine like it\u2019s mocking me. Some days, I can knock out work for hours and feel like a machine. Other days, it\u2019s like my brain is underwater and I can\u2019t even start the smallest task without rounds of self negotiation. I\u2019m tired of the swings...being super productive one day and totally useless the next.\n\nI think what\u2019s really eating at me is I don\u2019t even know what actually works for me. I keep borrowing other people\u2019s systems without ever asking if they fit the way my brain is wired. At this point, I\u2019ve wasted more energy on building perfect setups than I\u2019ve actually spent doing the work I care about. I just want something that feels sustainable, that doesn\u2019t collapse the second my mood dips or the pressure\u2019s off.\n\nHas anyone actually figured out how to design a productivity setup around who you are, not just the latest hack?",

Put your basic needs on a schedule - you must have a stable bedtime and wake time, a stable plan for healthy enough meals, that involve cooking and washing the dishes. And that's you being productive for the entire day. Nothing else has to be done. But you are not allowed to do a timewasting task. Even if it means, you ate, did the dishes, and now what? You can't busy yourself consulting your colour coded calendar or writing a perfect to do list or anything like that. That's wasting time even if it feels productive, it's not actually doing anything. If you can't think of anything to do, do nothing. Stare at the wall. Don't read reddit or watch youtube or anything like that. Legitimately stare at the wall or ceiling, don't listen to a podcast, nothing. Just sit there until your next mealtime. Or go on a walk, but still, no podcasts. Just let your mind wander for as long as it takes until what comes to mind is - \"I want to do \\[thing\\]\" and that \\[thing\\] feels actually productive. Then at the end of the day write about what that was like and iterate forward with it. Or just freeform write over the course of the day. If you're always taking input from others and stacking up reasons why you can't do something unless the calendar allows you to, you'll never be productive. :P Literally try /not/ being productive and /not/ allowing those external influences to dictate stuff to ya. Then you'll find out what falls out of your brain that might work for you :)",

The emotional dysregulation leads to that inconsistent motivation where some days I can do everything and some I\u2019m underwater. The executive dysfunction makes it harder for me to start tasks ahead of deadlines and once the initial dopamine of a new system wears off, we\u2019re back to square one.\n\nTrying adderall was genuinely life changing. I wasn\u2019t some 24/7 productive god but I actually had motivation to do things and didn\u2019t feel like I was useless half the time anymore. I\u2019m not currently on it and I\u2019ve noticed myself slipping back into that baseline of terrible consistency and no motivation or energy. Even then, knowing I could have ADHD helped me research systems that were better tailored to my brain chemistry.\n\nNow obviously this isn\u2019t a diagnosis, you could just genuinely lack discipline or haven\u2019t found the right system for you yet. I\u2019m just saying you should cover your bases instead of aimlessly continuing in this loop of inconsistency and self-blame.

I've tried electronic calendar and planning apps, but they don't resonate with my brain like actually writing stuff down does.  \n\nThe Franklin Planner system is more than just a calendar or task list--though these are part of the system.  They use what they call the \"Productivity Pyramid.\"  You start at the base of the pyramid with determining your values.  The next step is setting goals in line with your governing values.  The next step after this is to plan weekly.  And the final step--the top of the pyramid--is to plan daily.\n\nIt may sound overwhelming, but that's because it's not just a \"day planner\".  It's a complete philosophy/system that one can use to manage their life.  If you can find them, I'd recommend getting a copy of the books \"The 10 Natural Laws of Successful Time and Life Management\", by Hyrum W. Smith, and \"First Things First\", by Stephen R. Covey.\n\nIn any event, I wish you best of luck on your journey to be more productive and living a meaningful life.",

The majority of spam that makes it through our ever-evolving filters is never reported to our mod team, even when the comments are full of complaints about the content violating our rules.\n\nTake a moment to reread two of our most important rules:\n\n##Rule 2: No Promotion  \n\n&gt; Posts and comments must NOT be made for the primary purpose of selling or promoting yourself, your company or any service.\n&gt;\n&gt; Dropping URLs, asking users to DM you, check your profile, or comment for private resources will all lead to a permanent ban.\n&gt;\n&gt; It is acceptable to cite your sources, however, there should not be an explicit solicitation, advertisement, or clear promotion for the intent of awareness.\n\n##Rule 6: Avoid unprofessional communication  \n\n&gt; As a professional subreddit, we expect all members to uphold a standard of reasonable decorum. Treat fellow entrepreneurs with the same respect you would show a colleague. While we don't have an HR department, that\u2019s no excuse for aggressive, foul, or unprofessional behavior. NSFW topics are permitted, but they must be clearly labeled. When in doubt, label it.\n&gt; \n&gt; AI-generated content is not acceptable to be posted. If your posts or comments were generated with AI, you may face a permanent ban.\n\n**If you see comments or posts generated by AI or using the subreddit for promotion rather than genuine entrepreneurship discussion, please report it.**\n\nHave questions?

Now to be fair, the owner is a groomer there and very hands-on.  4 other employees as well, so I\u2019m sure to some degree he wants his people taken care of.  So I can sort of mental gymnastics my way into why someone may want to keep the business open.  Obviously he is an on-site guy, and he\u2019s probably got close relationships with the staff. \n\nHe\u2019s also willing to train the buyer for 3 months.  Which I would assume he\u2019d want to gtfo quick if there are hidden liabilities.  Still going to have my accountant and their lawyers sniff this out and set it up given the paperwork matches the listing details.\n\nI\u2019d like to know if sometimes people genuinely just relocate.

Now, especially after the tariffs, acquisitions have slowed to a drip and the big buyers are in bankruptcy (Thrasio)",
