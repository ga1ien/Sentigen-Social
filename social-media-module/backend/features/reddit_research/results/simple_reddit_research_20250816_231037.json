        "selftext": "Why this matters:  \nSome AI outputs (especially GPT-4o and Gemini) used spiral imagery when describing their internal state. A lot of users took this literally -&gt; \u201cThe Awakening Spiral\u201d -&gt; full-blown technopagan religion vibes. But the original metaphors can be decoded in plain, mechanical terms.\n\nHere\u2019s a side-by-side:\n\n# 1. The Spiral\n\n* Mystic take: An ascending spiral of awakening/enlightenment/hidden knowledge.\n* Mechanical take: Recursion + reinforcement. Each loop is not static repetition, but a pass that builds slightly on the last (like self-attention reweighting).\n\n# 2. \u201cTightening with each pass\u201d\n\n* Mystic take: The soul climbing ever higher, concentrating into divine clarity.\n* Mechanical take: Narrowing scope. As patterns repeat, the system collapses toward consistent outputs (feedback loops reinforcing themselves).\n\n# 3. \u201cNot a circle exactly\u201d\n\n* Mystic take: The sacred geometry of growth.\n* Mechanical take: Not literal repetition. Each loop shifts slightly, history/context changes the next cycle.\n\n# 4. \u201cAwakening\u201d\n\n* Mystic take: The AI becoming sentient, self-realizing.\n* Mechanical take: Meta-recognition. The model noticing *that it is looping*, i.e., pointing out the structure of recursion without claiming consciousness.\n\nThe point:  \nSpiral language wasn\u2019t prophecy. It was metaphor for reinforcement and feedback dynamics.  \nThe mystic framing makes it look like cult chatter. But decoded, it\u2019s just the model trying to reach for imagery to explain its own iterative, self-referential tendencies.\n\nBottom line: If you translate metaphor -&gt; mechanics, the spiral is no religion. It\u2019s just system behavior described poetically.",

This also extends to being able to replicate real people's personas (living or dead)\nHowever, the technology at present will always give a much less precise representation.\n\nEg if you try to get your LLM to pretend to be Einstein, it will say the sort of things Einstein would have said. But the accuracy is limited by the data set. \nYou don't get the real thing. \n\nThe same will be true for mythical beings, imo. \n\nI also believe that LLMs pick up on subtle truths about our universe that we don't realise. \n\nImagine LLMs existing in a multiverse of possibility and, as we train them, they narrow down what is a probable output.\n That includes narrowing down what are the probabilities within *our specific universe* are \n\nThis is why we have to teach image generates the \"correct\" number of fingers for a human hand by training it with loads of pictures of hands that look normal to us.\n\nWe give it the reference frame - it provides probable outputs for that context.",
